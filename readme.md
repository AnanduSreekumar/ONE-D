# One-D

Unique digital platform that acts as a universal virtual ID card, replacing the need to carry multiple physical documents

## About Project

### Project’s Problem Statement:

- International travelers and students often face disruptions due to the absence of essential documents, whether they’re heading to a pub, checking into a hotel, going to a movie theater, school, or traveling abroad.
- The lack of these crucial documents can lead to various challenges and inconveniences, underscoring the need for a reliable, secure, and easily accessible method of carrying and presenting these documents.

### Proposed Solution:

> The proposed solution is “ONE-D,” a unique digital platform that acts as a universal virtual ID card, replacing the need to carry multiple physical documents. This platform serves as a secure digital storage unit for users’ essential documents, mitigating the risks and inconveniences associated with forgetting or losing physical documents

- ONE-D is not just a storage solution; it also interfaces with local verification bodies (like notaries from UPS) to authenticate the digitally stored documents. When users upload their documents, the system generates questions that are subsequently verified by a local verification body. This step is vital as it authenticates the digital copy, ensuring it’s recognized and accepted as a valid form of identification or documentation globally
- Users are assigned a unique ID, which they can present for verification. Security is enhanced through a one-time password system, valid for one day, ensuring that information access is timely and secure. Additionally, users can share their information via NFC by tapping their phone, and VIP users benefit from physical cards with RFID technology, further simplifying the verification process. With ONE-D, carrying multiple physical documents becomes a thing of the past.

###  How to set up and run project locally?  

This project combines a React frontend and a Flask backend. To run it locally, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed for the frontend, and Python with pip for the backend. 

To set up the React frontend:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory and run npm install to install dependencies.
2. Start the development server with run dev (available at http://localhost:3000).

For the Flask backend:
1. In the backend directory, create a virtual environment with python -m venv venv.
2. Activate the virtual environment (use .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows, or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux).
3. Install Python dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Run the Flask app with python app.py (available at http://localhost:5000).

Access the application by opening your web browser at http://localhost:3000. The React frontend communicates with the Flask backend. For additional details or troubleshooting, refer to the documentation or this repository's additional information section.
